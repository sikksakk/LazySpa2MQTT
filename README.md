First version of my LazySpa2MQTT script which I use together with openHAB.

This is just a basic script, feeding values from the API into MQTT subjects.
Plan is to extend it to also be able to turn on/off pump and adjust temp setpoint..
Also my very first python script :-) (so dont kill me..)

Run the script ie. every 30min in a cron.
